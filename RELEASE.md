# Release notes

## v0.0.1
Upgrade from Laravel mix to vite.

After upgrading to qbixxassignment v0.0.1 your blade views will apply the @vite directive. Hence, after running composer install you need to clear the view cache as well.

```sh
php artisan view:clear
```

Next you should remove in the public folder, the assets which were previously generated by Laravel mix.

Finally you can apply the new vite scripts and enjoy a fast development experience!
